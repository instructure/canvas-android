Intimidate your opponents with chemical warfare.\n• Eat a large meal right before playing. Ensure everyone enjoys the smell of company lunch a second time.\n• Eliminate any ventilation. Who knows when a stray draft might shift the ball and cost you the game?\n• Be as loud as possible. Surely you can level up your game through sheer volume.\n• Use brute strength instead of skill. Break some equipment and tell nobody.</string>
