# Flutter Student Embed

A Flutter module embedded into the Canvas Student app.

## Getting Started

Prior to building the Student app for the first time, [install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) the Flutter SDK and run `flutter pub get` from this directory.
This will generate a `.android` directory that Gradle needs to correctly import this Flutter module into the Canvas Student project.
