/**
 * A [ClassTransformer] that works around a bug in the flutter_embedding dependency which causes the accessibility
 * borders for Flutter elements to be drawn with an incorrect offset.
 *
 * To interface with Android's accessibility layer and replicate the interaction behaviors that users expect, Flutter
 * internally tracks a hierarchy of virtual views (via the AccessibilityBridge class) that acts as a middle man between
 * Flutter's widget tree and Android's accessibility APIs. However, in its current state it does not seem to account
 * for non-fullscreen use cases of FlutterView (the Android View that attaches to the Flutter engine), causing the
 * virtual view bounds to be reported relative to the FlutterView bounds rather than to the screen bounds. This
 * ultimately results in the system drawing the accessibility 'highlight' borders for Flutter elements with an
 * incorrect offset.
 *
 * The one exception to this behavior happens in 'AccessibilityBridge.updateSemantics', where a transformation is
 * applied to the virtual views to match the window's left inset, covering a case where Android displays the
 * navigation bar on the left side of the screen in landscape mode.
 *
 * Fortunately, because our embedded usage of Flutter also aligns with the top window inset, we are able to patch
 * the flutter_embedding jar in order to hijack that transformation, modifying it to include the top inset in
 * addition to the left inset.
 *
 * Note that this patch will not account for additional offsets of the FlutterView (due to padding/margin) or for cases
 * where the FlutterView is otherwise misaligned with the window insets.
 *
 * As with all jar patches, this transformer is designed for a specific dependency version and may cease working
 * if the dependency is updated.
