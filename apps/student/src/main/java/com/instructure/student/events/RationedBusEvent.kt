/**
 * A bus event which only allows each subscriber access to the event payload once. Designed to be
 * used as a sticky event, [RationedBusEvent] should be used in components which need to receive
 * specific events exactly once but which may not currently live in memory.
 *
 * Example: The Courses page and the All Courses page both display cached data (if available). If a
 * user opens a course from the Courses page and edits its name, both the Courses page and All
 * Courses page will need to force read from the network to avoid showing stale data. The Courses
 * page is in memory while the All Courses page is not. By sending a sticky [RationedBusEvent],
 * the Courses page can immediately refresh with new data and the All Courses page will know to
 * skip the cache the next time it is instantiated.
 *
 * @param[T] The type of payload held by this [RationedBusEvent] instance
 * @param[payload] The payload held by this [RationedBusEvent] instance
 * @param[skipId] (Optional) A subscriber ID to skip, useful when the class sending the event is
 * also subscribed to receive events of the same type but wishes to ignore this specific event.
 * Generally this ID will be the simple name of the subscribing class (e.g. [Class.getSimpleName])
