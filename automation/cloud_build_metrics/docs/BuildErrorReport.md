## Solution

The Bitrise API allows us to download and parse the build output for each failed job. In addition to pinpointing exactly
 which steps failed, weâ€™re also able to get additional details on the error message via a regular expression. 
 Automating error reporting has saved us a significant amount of time when diagnosing infrastructure failures 
 identified by the build graphs. Previously, an engineer would have to manually click through each build and
 figure out what step failed.

```kotlin
override fun execute() {
    val targetAppSlug = "57b22415f35222e3"
    val appsInOrg = BitriseApps.getAppsForOrg()

    println("Found ${appsInOrg.size} apps in org")
    val app = appsInOrg.first { it.slug == targetAppSlug }

    println("Building error report for ${app.title}")
    val weekStart = LocalDate.parse("Monday, January 7 2019", prettyDateTimeYear)
    val range = weekRange(52, weekStart)

    println("${range.after.pretty()} - ${range.before.pretty()}")
    buildErrorReport(app,
            deleteCache = false,
            limitAfter = range.limitAfter,
            limitBefore = range.limitBefore)
}
```
