## Solution

The build activity report allows us to easily identify jobs that are abandoned based on the last build time.
Itâ€™s great being able to see exactly what jobs are active and inactive. Pruning inactive jobs was a bit painful 
before this report existed.

```kotlin
override fun execute() {
    jobActivityReport(BitriseApps)
}
```
